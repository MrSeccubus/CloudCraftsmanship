Trust
=====

Using a cloud technology implies a level op trust in it's provider and the abilities of the provider. As Ronald Reagan put it:

> Trust, but verify

Verification of trust of a cloud provider is not an easy task. 

The following list is a list of globally recognized frameworks/standards/reports that can help you in obtaining assurance on a cloud provider.

* Cloud Security Alliance - [CSA Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (START)](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/star/)
* [ISO9001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9000#ISO_9000_series_Quality_Management_Principles) - Global Quality Standard
* [ISO22301]() - Business Continuity Management
* [ISO27001]() - Security Management Controls
* [ISO27017]() - Cloud Specific Controls
* [ISO27018]() - Personal Data Protection
* [PCI DSS]() - Payment Card Data Security Standards
* [SOC 1]() - AICPA System and Organisation Controls

There are many more local, regional and industry frameworks, standards, reports, laws and regulations. Listing them all would go way beyond the scope of this article.
