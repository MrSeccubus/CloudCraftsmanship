Shared responsibility
===

Most cloud providers take security very seriously. They have to in order to exist and keep existing. 

However there is only so much cloud providers can do for your security. E.g. if you are careless with your credentials for a SaaS solution, somebody else may steal them and hyou data may be compromised. Keeping your credentials security is your task.

AWS and Azure have named this the "Shared Responsibility" model. In short it means that the provider is responsible for the security **of** the cloud and the customer is responsibile for the security **in** the cloud.

Cloud Checkr has an [excellent article](https://cloudcheckr.com/cloud-security/shared-responsibility-model/) on this subject.
