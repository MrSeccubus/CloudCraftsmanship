While the term craftsmanship and crafts is sometimes associated with with quint and outdates activities such as cheese 
making or basket knitting, we feel that the paradigm of applying obtained skills, knowledge and aptitude as well as a
little tradition perfectly applies to delivering high quality IT services.

Accoording to the [Wikipedia definition of carftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan) (by the synonim artisan):  

> (a craftsman) practices a [craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) and may through experience and aptitude reach 
the expressive levels of an artist.

In turn it [defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) a craft as follows:

> A craft or trade is a pastime or a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work.

We identify ourselves as Craftsmen, because we take pride in our jobs. Jobs that take skill, knowledge, experience and aptitude
to do well.
