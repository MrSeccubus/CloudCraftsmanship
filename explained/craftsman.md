# Craftsmanship

> #### I am a craftsman. I use cloud technologies, because I apply my craftmanship to cloud technologies, I am a Cloud Craftsman. 

## Cloud is inevitable
Cloud technologies, if applied correctly, offer great benefirs in terms of availabilitu, reliability, scalability and agility. Many organisations need rely on these benefits to be able to what they do or be as good as they are. Cloud is not just 'your data on somebody else's computer' but an ecosystem that allows us to do things that were otherwise not possible or inefficient. 

Using cloud technologies effectively, efficiently and securly is trivial, but requires skill and dedication, in other words it requires craftsmanship.

## What is craftsmanship?

While the term craftsmanship and crafts is sometimes associated with with quint and outdates activities such as cheese 
making or basket knitting, we feel that the paradigm of applying obtained skills, knowledge and aptitude as well as a
little tradition perfectly applies to delivering high quality IT services.

According to the [Wikipedia definition of carftsman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan) (by the synonim artisan):  

> (a craftsman) practices a [craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) and may through experience and aptitude reach 
the expressive levels of an artist.

In turn it [defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craft) a craft as follows:

> A craft or trade is a pastime or a profession that requires particular skills and knowledge of skilled work.

We identify ourselves as Craftsmen, because we take pride in our jobs. Jobs that take skill, knowledge, experience and aptitude to do well.
