> I recognize that effective, efficient and secure usage of cloud technologies is in the interest of both the user and provider.

The [shared responsibility](shared_responsibility.md) implicates that both the provider and user have a responsibility and and interest in this.

As stated before, the provider is responsible **for** the cloud, the user **in** the cloud. So the provider is responsible for providing services that **can** be used effectively, efficiently and secure, but it is up to the users that the **are** used effectively, efficiently and secure.

Because both are in the providers interest, they often supply a lot of material to explain how to achieve this. These are often referred to as [best practices](best_practices.md).
