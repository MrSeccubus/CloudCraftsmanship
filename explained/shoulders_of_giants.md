Standing on the shoulders of giants
===================================

As stated before, the provider is responsible **for** the cloud, the user **in** the cloud. So the provider is responsible for providing services that **can** be used effectively, efficiently and securely, but it is up to the user tomake sure that they **are** used effectively, efficiently and securly.

Because both are in the providers interest, they often supply a lot of material to explain how to achieve this in the form of best practices and tooling.

Additionally many organisation rely on cloud services. So of them have released their tooling fo others to use. These tools can be of great benefit to the Cloud Craftsman. 

The community op open source tools does not workwithout your contribution. If you can create, maintain or improve a tool and please give it back to the community.
