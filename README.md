> <img src="images/openquote.png" width="80" height="60"/>

> ### I am a craftsman and I use cloud technologies, because I apply my craftmanship to cloud technologies, I am a Cloud Craftsman.
>
> ### I recognize that cloud technologies, if applied correctly, offer great benefits in terms of availability, reliability, scalability and agility.
>
> ### I recognize that, like any other technology, cloud technology is not a silver bullit.
>
> ### I recognize that the use of [cloud technology implies a level of trust in the provider](/explained/trust.md) of said technology, I will do my best to validate that trust.
>
> ### I recognize that effective, efficient and secure usage of cloud technologies is a responsibility that is shared between the user and the provider.
>
> ### I recognize that effective, efficient and secure uadge of cloud technologies is in both the interest of the user and provider.
>
> ### I intend to read, understand and/or use the best practices and tooling recommended by the provider to the greatest extend possible in my situation.
>
> ### I intend to stand on the shoulders of giants. May before us have developed tools and practices for the effective, efficient and secure usage of cloud technologies. I will adopt their work as much as I can.
>
> ### I recognize that cloud technologies are repaidly evolving, this means I will have to keep up with the current state of the cloud technologies I intend to use and are available to me. After all, a fool with a tool is still a fool.
>
> ### I recognize that automation is the key to reliability, reproducability and recoverability. I will embrace automation of my work as the way forward.
>
> ### I recognize that, in the cloud, I cannot rely on others to provide security for me.
> 
> ### _I am a Cloud Craftsman, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary and I am up for the challenge._
