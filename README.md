> ### <img src="images/openquote.png" width="80" height="60"/> I am a craftsman and I use cloud technologies, because I apply my [craftmanship](explained/craftsman.md) to cloud technologies, I am a Cloud Craftsman. <span class='small'>[More...](explained/craftsman.md)</span>
>
> ### I recognize that cloud technologies, if applied correctly, offer great benefits in terms of availability, reliability, scalability and agility.
>
> ### I recognize that, like any other technology, cloud technology is not a silver bullet.
>
> ### I recognize that not all cloud solutions are created equally. I will do my best to select solutions that fits my specific situation. <!--<span class='small'>[More...](explained/selection.md)</span>-->
> 
> ### I recognize that, in the cloud, I will have to trust and rely on the abilities of the provider. I will do my best to validate this trust. <span class='small'>[More...](explained/trust.md)</span>
>
> ### I recognize that effective, efficient and secure usage of cloud technologies is a responsibility that is shared between the user and the provider. <span class='small'>[More...](explained/shared_responsibility.md)</span>
>
> ### I recognize that effective, efficient and secure usage of cloud technologies is in the interest of both the user and provider. <span class='small'>[More...](explained/mutual_interest.md)</span>
>
> ### I intend to read, understand and/or use the best practices and tooling recommended by the provider to the greatest extend possible in my situation. <span class='small'>[More...](explained/best_practices)</span>

>
> ### I intend to stand on the shoulders of giants. Many before us have developed tools and practices for the effective, efficient and secure usage of cloud technologies. I will adopt their work as much as I can. If I can improve and give back to the community I will allow others to stand on my shoulders as well.
>
> ### I recognize that cloud technologies are repidly evolving, this means I will have to keep up with the current state of the cloud technologies I intend to use and are available to me. After all, a fool with a tool is still a fool.
>
> ### I recognize that automation is the key to reliability, reproducability and recoverability. I will embrace automation of my work as the way forward.
>
> ### I recognize that, in the cloud, I cannot rely on others to provide security for me.
> 
> ### _I am a Cloud Craftsman, not because it is easy, but because it is necessary and I am up for the challenge._
